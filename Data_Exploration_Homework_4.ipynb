So I told her that if this is how she treats herself, I'd be concerned about being her patient. She was shocked and told me that was uncalled for. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  My daughter is getting married soon. I only learned about her a few years ago. We've been building a relationship the last few years though and I am lucky to have her in my life now. Recently, she asked me to walk her down the aisle and while I am honored I told her no. Her step-dad practically raised her from a baby and I think that he deserves it far more than me. She was really upset and hurt when I said no. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

I live with my girlfriend, who comes from a poor family, and we split things 50-50. Recently, she found out how much money my parents send me each month and freaked out, saying it wasn't fair that I was making her split things 50/50. I told her it was my money, and it only seems fair if we cover half the expenses. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  I saw a poster for a lost cat advertising a 500 dollar reward. I saw the cat, tracked it down, and called the owner. When I met with them, they said there wasn't actually a reward, they had just listed one because they thought it would motivate people to find the cat. I kept the cat until they coughed up the reward money. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  My sister's nine year old daughter is poorly behaved. One day, my sister dropped the daughter off on my doorstep without my consent and drove off, texting me that she needed me to watch her daughter for the day. The daughter complained of being hungry, so I gave her the leftovers I had. She said she didn't like them, but I told her that's all there was. She put them in the microwave until they burned, then told me she couldn't eat them and we would have to go out and get food. I told her that was what there was to eat, and if she ruined it she'd have to wait for her mom to get back. Later, everyone yelled at me for 'starving' a child. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  My parents want us to come out for their anniversary, and bought my sister and I tickets on the same flight. My sister has two kids - a 6 month old and a 5 year old. She is currently separated from her husband so she would have to handle 2 children by herself on a 10 hour flight.\\n\\nShe calls me up a week or so beforehand and asks me if I will be willing to help her take care of her kids on the flight, and something about taking shifts so we can both sleep. I tell her that I wasn't comfortable with that, but she says \"nephew loves you so much\" so we can work something out on the flight and hangs up.\\n\\nWhen I got to the airport, I chose to upgrade my seat so I could sit by myself and didn't mention it until we were on the plane. My family freaked and told me I abandoned my sister. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  I'm a single mom with four kids, one of whom has a different father from the other three. I get a lot of child support for one of them, and none for the other 3. 2/3rds of the child support for the eldest go towards his expenses and college fund. The other third goes towards my other children. My friend recently found out and told me it was inappropriate to use the child support intended for the one on the other three. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  I have a child with a mother who never wanted anything to do with them. I make enough money to cover my expenses, but I constantly check up on the child's mother to make sure she's paying adequate child support. Periodically I either hire an investigator or her mom just tells me she got a raise and I go to court to adjust the child support accordingly. The last time I did this, she didn't show up for court and I apparently overestimated how much her raise was and I got a default judgment. She called me up and practically pleaded with me to lower her payments after I said no she insulted me and my son. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  My daughter is getting married soon. I only learned about her a few years ago. We've been building a relationship the last few years though and I am lucky to have her in my life now. Recently, she asked me to walk her down the aisle and while I am honored I told her no. Her step-dad practically raised her from a baby and I think that he deserves it far more than me. She was really upset and hurt when I said no. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  I saw a poster for a lost cat advertising a 500 dollar reward. I saw the cat, tracked it down, and called the owner. When I met with them, they said there wasn't actually a reward, they had just listed one because they thought it would motivate people to find the cat. I kept the cat until they coughed up the reward money. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  My sister's nine year old daughter is poorly behaved. One day, my sister dropped the daughter off on my doorstep without my consent and drove off, texting me that she needed me to watch her daughter for the day. The daughter complained of being hungry, so I gave her the leftovers I had. She said she didn't like them, but I told her that's all there was. She put them in the microwave until they burned, then told me she couldn't eat them and we would have to go out and get food. I told her that was what there was to eat, and if she ruined it she'd have to wait for her mom to get back. Later, everyone yelled at me for 'starving' a child. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  My parents want us to come out for their anniversary, and bought my sister and I tickets on the same flight. My sister has two kids - a 6 month old and a 5 year old. She is currently separated from her husband so she would have to handle 2 children by herself on a 10 hour flight.\\n\\nShe calls me up a week or so beforehand and asks me if I will be willing to help her take care of her kids on the flight, and something about taking shifts so we can both sleep. I tell her that I wasn't comfortable with that, but she says \"nephew loves you so much\" so we can work something out on the flight and hangs up.\\n\\nWhen I got to the airport, I chose to upgrade my seat so I could sit by myself and didn't mention it until we were on the plane. My family freaked and told me I abandoned my sister. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  I'm a single mom with four kids, one of whom has a different father from the other three. I get a lot of child support for one of them, and none for the other 3. 2/3rds of the child support for the eldest go towards his expenses and college fund. The other third goes towards my other children. My friend recently found out and told me it was inappropriate to use the child support intended for the one on the other three. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  I have a child with a mother who never wanted anything to do with them. I make enough money to cover my expenses, but I constantly check up on the child's mother to make sure she's paying adequate child support. Periodically I either hire an investigator or her mom just tells me she got a raise and I go to court to adjust the child support accordingly. The last time I did this, she didn't show up for court and I apparently overestimated how much her raise was and I got a default judgment. She called me up and practically pleaded with me to lower her payments after I said no she insulted me and my son. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

              "  I was in a conflict with my mother-in-law's boyfriend, in which I made a snide comment about he's never paid child support to his ex. Later, he called me and told me if I ever said anything like that ever again he'd sue me for defamation. I took the threat seriously, as he is a lawyer, and uninvited him for our wedding and told my family I couldn't be around him anymore. Am I a jerk?  \\\n",

        "A p-value of 0.2745 indicates that there is no significant evidence to suggest a relationship between selecting 'Strongly a jerk' and being in Max's class compared to Fardina's class. In other words, the p-value is greater than the common alpha level of 0.01, suggesting that any observed differences could be due to random chance rather than a meaningful relationship. Therefore, in this context, the data does not provide sufficient evidence to support the idea that the preference for 'Strongly a jerk' responses is associated with a specific class. From looking at the pie charts there are more people that chose 'Strongly a jerk' in Max's class but it is not significant enough to conclude that there is any association seen through the chi-squared test."
